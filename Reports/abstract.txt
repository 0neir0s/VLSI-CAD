Quine-McCluskey Procedure for minimization of SOP expression (2-level logic minimization)

-Should work for any number of variables (can have upper limit).
-generation of primes, and then solving set cover (e.g. branch-and-bound)

Variations/additional items :
-handling 'dont-care's;
-minimizing for two functions simultaneously (sharing).

Verifying correctness. (e.g. by truth table) (can use existing package like boolean/PyEDA for verifying correctness)
